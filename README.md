This participatory map caters to tourists visiting Seattle, as well as the local community, University of Washington (UW) community, and general users interested in exploring the city. It serves as a collaborative platform where tourists can discover aesthetic and fun places recommended by locals and UW community members, providing them with an authentic experience beyond typical tourist attractions. Local community members are encouraged to actively participate by adding their favorite spots, hidden gems, and personal recommendations, thus showcasing their knowledge of the area and promoting lesser-known locations. Similarly, UW community members can share their favorite spots around the campus and surrounding neighborhoods, fostering a sense of community and connection. General users can benefit from the diverse range of recommendations on the map, whether they are locals seeking new places to explore or visitors looking for authentic experiences. 
 Together, this participatory map creates a dynamic and inclusive space for sharing, discovering, and exploring the vibrant attractions of Seattle.
