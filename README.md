This participatory map caters to tourists visiting Seattle, as well as the local community, University of Washington (UW) community, and general users interested in exploring the city. It serves as a collaborative platform where tourists can discover aesthetic and fun places recommended by locals and UW community members, providing them with an authentic experience beyond typical tourist attractions. Local community members are encouraged to actively participate by adding their favorite spots, hidden gems, and personal recommendations, thus showcasing their knowledge of the area and promoting lesser-known locations. Similarly, UW community members can share their favorite spots around the campus and surrounding neighborhoods, fostering a sense of community and connection. General users can benefit from the diverse range of recommendations on the map, whether they are locals seeking new places to explore or visitors looking for authentic experiences. Together, this participatory map creates a dynamic and inclusive space for sharing, discovering, and exploring the vibrant attractions of Seattle.

## Final Thoughts

This text provides a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on how to create a minimum viable participatory mapping project using several technical skills and platforms, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, command line, Node.js, PostgreSQL, GitHub, and
However, the complexity of the tutorial implies that this process is best suited for those with a foundational understanding of the technologies involved. The tutorial may be overwhelming for those without a background in these technologies or novice users. Furthermore, the cost of Heroku services could also be a limiting factor for some.

 Despite some limitations, with careful execution and continuous enhancements, it can serve as an empowering platform that truly reflects the lived experiences of communities. As digital geographers continue to explore this field, we can expect to see more diverse and inclusive mapping projects that capture the myriad ways in which we relate to and experience our environment.
